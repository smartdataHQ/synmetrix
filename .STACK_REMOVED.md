# Stack Container Removed

The `synmetrix/stack` container has been removed from the selective build workflow due to build failures.

**Issue:** The stack container build was consistently failing, causing the entire build matrix to be marked as failed even when other services built successfully.

**Solution:** Removed from:
- Change detection paths
- Matrix generation
- Manual trigger options
- Build summary

**Current Services (6 total):**
- actions → quicklookup/synmetrix-actions
- cubejs → quicklookup/synmetrix-cube  
- client → quicklookup/synmetrix-client
- hasura-cli → quicklookup/synmetrix-hasura
- hasura-backend-plus → quicklookup/hasura-backend-plus
- stepci → quicklookup/synmetrix-stepci
