### üîç Key Observations

This pipeline is **functionally solid and well-structured** for a selective multi-service Docker build-and-push GitHub Actions workflow. It introduces optimizations like:

- **Path filtering** on `push` and `pull_request` triggers
- **Manual override (`workflow_dispatch`)** with input control for granular builds
- **Change detection logic** to determine service-specific build targets
- **Dynamic matrix generation**
- **Multi-platform docker builds with caching and metadata**
- **Push gating based on PR vs branch build vs manual inputs**
- **Structured summary output in GitHub UI**

However, several improvements can make the pipeline more **robust, maintainable, and DRY-compliant**.

### üîß Suggestions for Improvement

#### 1. **Deduplicate Service Matching Logic**
The `detect-changes` step has hardcoded, repeated `git diff` calls per service:

```bash
if git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }}..${{ github.sha }} | grep -q "^services/actions/";
```

**Replace with a loop** using an associative array for better maintainability:

```bash
declare -A SERVICE_PATHS=(
  ["actions"]="services/actions/"
  ["cubejs"]="services/cubejs/"
  ["client"]="services/client/"
  ["hasura-cli"]="scripts/containers/hasura-cli/|services/hasura/"
  ["hasura-backend-plus"]="scripts/containers/hasura-backend-plus/"
  ["stack"]="scripts/containers/stack/"
  ["stepci"]="scripts/containers/stepci/"
)

CHANGED_SERVICES=""
for service in "${!SERVICE_PATHS[@]}"; do
  if git diff --name-only "${{ github.event.before }}..${{ github.sha }}" | grep -E -q "^(${SERVICE_PATHS[$service]})"; then
    CHANGED_SERVICES="$CHANGED_SERVICES,$service"
  fi
done
```

---

#### 2. **Avoid `sed` for Comma Trimming**
Better to use shell parameter expansion or `cut`/`awk` instead of sed:

```bash
CHANGED_SERVICES="${CHANGED_SERVICES#,}"
```

Avoids spawning a new process.

---

#### 3. **Extract Matrix Template as Reusable JSON**
Instead of constructing the matrix JSON inline in shell, move it to a YAML or JSON file committed in the repo (`.github/matrix-config.json`):

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "image": "quicklookup/synmetrix-actions",
    "context": "services/actions",
    "dockerfile": "services/actions/Dockerfile"
  },
  ...
}
```

Then parse and build matrix with `jq`, which is already available on GitHub runners. This increases maintainability and lets you use the same mapping in other workflows.

---

#### 4. **Separate Cache Scope for Each Service**
Currently, `cache-from/to` uses `gha` (global shared cache). Use **per-service cache keys** for granularity:

```yaml
cache-from: type=gha,scope=${{ matrix.service }}
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max,scope=${{ matrix.service }}
```

Prevents cache contention or overwrites.

---

#### 5. **Better Boolean Parsing for Workflow Inputs**
Input booleans are strings (`"true"`/`"false"`). Ensure this is handled safely:

```bash
if [[ "${{ github.event.inputs.push_images }}" == "true" ]]; then
```

And consider coercing to lowercase to avoid errors:

```bash
INPUT=$(echo "${{ github.event.inputs.push_images }}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
if [[ "$INPUT" == "true" ]]; then
```

---

#### 6. **Matrix Output Capture in Summary Job**
GitHub doesn't directly expose matrix step outputs to downstream jobs. You‚Äôre reconstructing output via `services` only, which is coarse. If you want **fine-grained info** (e.g., per image digest, tag), consider using `artifacts` or `output files` written to `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and picked up later.

---

#### 7. **Optional: Refactor Using Composite Actions**
Extract common logic (e.g., Docker login, metadata, build) into a **composite GitHub Action** for internal reuse across workflows.

---

#### 8. **Type Consistency in Workflow Inputs**
You're mixing input types:

```yaml
push_images:
  type: boolean
```

vs

```yaml
services:
  default: 'all'
```

Consider switching `services` to an `array` type with `[]` default and transform it in Bash. This makes GitHub UI controls cleaner.

---

#### 9. **Optional: Support for Additional Triggers**
Support `pull_request_target` to allow builds for forks when secrets are not required (no push), or enable `repository_dispatch` to allow cross-repo triggers.

---

#### 10. **YAML Linting and Syntax Simplification**
Minor:
- `if: always()` could be removed entirely if `needs.detect-changes.outputs.services` already guards build execution.
- Double-quote all shell variables.
