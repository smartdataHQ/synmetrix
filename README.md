## Overview

Synmetrix leverages [Cube (Cube.js)](https://github.com/cube-js/cube) to implement flexible data models that can consolidate metrics from across warehouses, databases, APIs and more. This unified semantic layer eliminates differences in definitions and calculations, providing a single source of truth.

The metrics data model can then be distributed downstream to any consumer via a SQL API, allowing integration into BI tools, reporting, dashboards, data science, and more.

By combining best practices from data engineering, like caching, orchestration, and transformation, with self-service analytics capabilities, Synmetrix speeds up data-driven workflows from metrics definition to consumption.

### Use cases

1. **Data Democratization**: Synmetrix makes data accessible to non-experts, enabling everyone in an organization to make data-driven decisions easily.

2. **Business Intelligence (BI) and Reporting**: Integrate Synmetrix with any BI tool for advanced reporting and analytics, enhancing data visualization and insights.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisite Software

Ensure the following software is installed before proceeding:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

### Step 1: Download the docker-compose file

The repository [mlcraft-io/mlcraft/install-manifests](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/tree/main/install-manifests) houses all the necessary installation manifests for deploying Synmetrix anywhere. You can download the docker compose file from this repository:

Execute this in a new directory
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/main/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
```

Alternatively, you can use `curl`

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/main/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
```

NOTE: Ensure to review the [environment variables](docs/environments.md) in the docker-compose.yml file. Modify them as necessary.

### Step 2: Launch Synmetrix

Execute the following command to start Synmetrix along with a Postgres database for data storage.

```
docker-compose pull stack && docker-compose up -d
```

Verify if the containers are operational:

```
docker ps
```

Output:
```
CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
c8f342d086f3 synmetrix/stack       ... 1m ago  Up 1m  80->8888/tcp ...
30ea14ddaa5e postgres:12           ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp  
```

The installation of all dependencies will take approximately 5-7 minutes. Wait until you see the `Synmetrix Stack is ready` message. You can view the logs using `docker-compose logs -f` to confirm if the process has completed.

#### Running Synmetrix on ARM64v8 Architecture

First, it's recommended to install [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102527) on your Mac. This will allow Docker to run ARM64v8 containers. Since Docker [version 4.25](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-desktop-4-25/) it allows to run ARM64v8 containers natively, but some users still encounter issues without Rosetta installed.

For ARM64v8, Cubestore requires a specific version. Update the Cubestore version in the docker-compose file to include the `-arm64v8` suffix. For instance, use `v0.35.33-arm64v8` (refer to the [Cubestore tags on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cubejs/cubestore/tags) for the latest version).

To run the docker-compose file for ARM64v8, use the following command:

```
docker-compose pull stack && CUBESTORE_VERSION=v0.35.33-arm64v8 docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Explore Synmetrix

* You can access Synmetrix at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
* The GraphQL endpoint is located at [http://localhost/v1/graphql](http://localhost/v1/graphql)
* The Admin Console (Hasura Console) can be found at [http://localhost/console](http://localhost/console)
* The Cube Swagger API can be found at [http://localhost:4000/docs](http://localhost:4000/docs)

#### Important Notes

1. **Admin Console Access**: Ensure to check `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` in the docker-compose file. This is mandatory for accessing the Admin Console. The default value is `adminsecret`. Remember to modify this in a production environment.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up all necessary environment variables. Synmetrix will function with the default values, but certain features might not perform as anticipated.

3. **Preloaded Seed Data**: The project is equipped with preloaded seed data. Use the credentials below to sign in:
    - Email:  `demo@synmetrix.org`
    - Password:  `demodemo`

    This account is pre-configured with two demo datasources and their respective SQL API access. For SQL operations, you can use the following credentials with any PostgreSQL client tool such as DBeaver or TablePlus:

    | Host      | Port  | Database | User                 | Password              |
    |-----------|-------|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|

## Data Modeling

Synmetrix leverages Cube for flexible data modeling and transformations.

Cube implements a multi-stage SQL data modeling architecture:

- Raw data sits in a source database such as Postgres, MySQL, etc.
- The raw data is modeled into reusable data marts using Cube Data Models files. These models files allow defining metrics, dimensions, granularities and relationships.
- The models act as an abstraction layer between the raw data and application code.
- Cube then generates optimized analytical SQL queries against the raw data based on the model.
- The Cube Store distributed cache optimizes query performance by caching query results.

This modeling architecture makes it simple to create fast and complex analytical queries with Cube that are optimized to run against large datasets.

The unified data model can consolidate metrics from across different databases and systems, providing a consistent semantic layer for end users.

## Cube Store

For production workloads, Synmetrix uses Cube Store as the caching and query execution layer.

Cube Store is a purpose-built database for operational analytics, optimized for fast aggregations and time series data. It provides:

- Distributed querying for scalability
- Advanced caching for fast queries
- columnar storage for analytics performance
- Integration with Cube for modeling

By leveraging Cube Store and Cube together, Synmetrix benefits from excellent analytics performance and flexibility in modeling metrics.
